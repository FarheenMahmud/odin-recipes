    Your Krabby Patties from the grill,
    The smell of grease gives me a thrill.
    <p>
        The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature and popular food item. 
        It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty; 
        it can also be ordered with cheese. The ingredients of the patty itself are purposely kept secret throughout the entire series, 
        but creator Stephen Hillenburg had stated that the patties are entirely vegetarian. It was created by Mr. Krabs and Plankton.
