        The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature and popular food item. 
        It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty; 
        it can also be ordered with cheese. The ingredients of the patty itself are purposely kept secret throughout the entire series, 
        but creator Stephen Hillenburg had stated that the patties are entirely vegetarian. It was created by Mr. Krabs and Plankton.

    <ol>
        <li>Trim and cut beef into 1-inch pieces, and spread evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes, along with the blade of a food processor, until beef is firm. Pulse in the food processor until beef is ground and pebbly. Shape into 4 patties, and season with salt, pepper, and MSG.</li>
